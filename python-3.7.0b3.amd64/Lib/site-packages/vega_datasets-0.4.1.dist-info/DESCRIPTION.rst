A Python package for offline access to Vega datasets available at
https://github.com/vega/vega-datasets.

This package has several goals:

- Provide straightforward access to the datasets in vega-datasets
- return the results in the form of a Pandas dataframe.
- wherever dataset size and/or license constraints make it possible, bundle the dataset with the package so that datasets can be loaded in the absence of a web connection.

Development at http://github.com/altair-viz/vega_datasets
